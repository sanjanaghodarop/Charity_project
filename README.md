# Charity_project
This Solidity-based smart contract enables a decentralized donation pool where anyone can contribute funds, and only the contract owner (charity) can withdraw donations securely. It ensures transparency through event logging and provides functions to check the total balance. Built for secure and efficient fundraising on the Ethereum blockchain.
